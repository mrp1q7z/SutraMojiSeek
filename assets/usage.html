<h4>Hint</h4>
<p>The timing to cast</p>
<p>At first, I think whether puzzled to do for chanting at any timing cursor will proceed on its own.
We are optimized to get cast in the following manner.</p>
<p>(1)Look at the character of the part of the white cursor, and then figure out how do I cast what. (It is not uttered at this point yet)</p>
<p>(2)Next, Say it out loud actually.At the same time I tap the screen. (The cursor will continue)
<p>(3)Go back to (1), and repeat.</p>
<p>Short, instead of cast at the moment when it became white, and cast when the cursor moves next.</p>
<p>The timing you cast it, I was allowed to reference the video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InkJE2PMX3Y" alt="" target="_balnk">Prajna-paramita Hrdaya Sutram</a> in the All Japan Soto Young Priests Association.</p>

<h3 id="head7">7. At the end</h3>
<p>The Heart Sutra, it is being preached the essence of Mahayana Buddhism, and appreciate sutra.</p>
<p>But, I do not know what sense at all times even after reading.</p>
<p>What recite without a sense, what you do not know the meaning, meaning me?</p>
<p>I wanted to know the meaning, I read a variety of interpretations of various people, but not really realize.</p>
<p>Among them, you may want to link this video I was able to understand and as I made​​.</p>
